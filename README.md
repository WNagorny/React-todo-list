# Todo-List

This repository contains a simple todo-list application built with JavaScript and React. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. The application also includes the functionality to store the tasks locally using the browser's local storage.

## Features

1. Add New Task: Users can add new tasks by providing a title and description for the task. Clicking the "Add" button will add the task to the list.

2. Delete Task: Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the trash icon next to the task. The task will be immediately removed from the list.

3. Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkmark icon next to the task. The task will be moved to the completed tasks section and display the completion time.

5. Switch Between Todo and Completed View: Users can switch between the todo and completed tasks view by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the application.
